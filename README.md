# Clirc

My first opensource project, originally posted on ... source forge, really; in like 2003.

I was a fresh-faced spruce 20 year old wannabe C hacker who had no idea what he was doing.

I wrote this irc network crawler that works; works your cpu, your disk, your network, as if
your computer needs exercise to stay fresh.

But no really, this is an interesting project; just large and strangely coded, even by 
my standards; which were non-existent at the time.

Perhaps I'll do documentation one day, when I take up drinking and writing, like some
F. Scott Fitzgerald of the open source world, only not as talented and not as careful.
